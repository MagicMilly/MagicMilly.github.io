    <h1>about magic milly</h1>
    <p>
      I first started working as a programmer at the University of Arizona in late 2019, after graduating from a data science bootcamp earlier that year. Prior to that, I worked as a psychiatric Registered Nurse for over five years. Harvard's free online <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">CS50</a> course was my first introduction to the world of programming. Writing the Mario half-pyramid in C took what felt like forever to solve, but once I did, the feeling of victory from using a foreign but exciting version of creative problem-solving was unforgettable. Changing careers to chase this feeling has been one of the best - and scariest - choices in my life.
