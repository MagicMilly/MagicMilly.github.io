      I first started working as a programmer at the University of Arizona in late 2019, after graduating from a data science bootcamp earlier that year. Prior to that, I worked as a psychiatric Registered Nurse for over five years. Harvard's free online <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">CS50</a> course was my first introduction to the world of programming. Writing the Mario half-pyramid in C took what felt like forever to solve, but once I did, the feeling of victory from using a foreign but exciting version of creative problem-solving was unforgettable. Changing careers to chase this feeling has been one of the best - and scariest - choices in my life.

      I was very lucky to find in my first position work that I cared about with a small, hybrid team of researchers and programmers. My first project curating data involved using the data wrangling skills I had learned in bootcamp, mostly with Python and Pandas in a Jupyter environment. As time and the project progressed, I inevitably found myself in unfamiliar territory where one might usually "learn on the job." This proved difficult for me for so many reasons, and I was soon surprised to find that a year had passed without a deeper knowledge of existing skills and barely any cultivation of new ones. This led to poor performance, anxiety about taking on new projects, and a negative feedback loop which felt impossible to escape. I am almost certain that there is at least one other person on Earth who has had a similar experience with <i>their</i> first job, so my mentor and I hatched an ambitious plan that we hope will transform into a roadmap from which other junior devs or junior <i>anythings</i> will benefit.

      Just last week - about one year since accepting this position - I asked to start working half-time, and my boss was not only receptive but also supportive of my plan. The other half of my time will be spent working and learning as a Software Craftsperson Apprentice, creating my own curriculum, building skills which will allow me to contribute more value to my team and community, feel better about myself, building projects to enhance my learning, and sharing my journey - the good, the bad, and everything else.
