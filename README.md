**The goal of my personal website will be to track and showcase what I've been planning, doing, and learning for my Apprenticeship to become a Software Craftsperson, with a higher, long-term goal of being able to share this experience and what we have learned with future Apprentices to not only lower the barrier of entry into this profession but to provide an alternative path to crafting and skill-building.** 

**You can track the progress of this project and my work on this kanban-style project [board](https://github.com/users/MagicMilly/projects/1).**
