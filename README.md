**The goal of my personal website has grown from documenting my progress specifically as a Software Craftsperson Apprentice to showcasing what I'm learning and exploring in other areas of life, and all of the magical mishaps along the way.** 

**You can track the progress of this project and my work on this kanban-style project [board](https://github.com/users/MagicMilly/projects/1).**
